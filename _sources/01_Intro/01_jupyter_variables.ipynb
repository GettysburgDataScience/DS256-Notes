    "## Jupyter Notebook Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter (stands for Julia-Python-R) Notebooks are coding environments that let you write, annotate, and run code a chunk at a time. These chunks are contained in *cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "The notebooks we'll use in this class comprise two kinds of cells:\n",
    " - *Markdown* - text annotation (like this cell).\n",
    " - *Code* - cells that will run code (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell type is noted in the lower right corner (and you can change the cell type from there).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running code, you'll have to select a Kernel (\"Select Kernel\" upper right corner of the coding window); if you forget, VS Code will prompt you to select a kernel when it gets to the first code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a kernel as a computational session and VS Code wants to know which version of Python you'd like to use to execute your code. It will present a list of installed Python distributions; you should select the one that has 'Anaconda' in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel also keeps track of all the variables you've created in the session. If you want to run your code from a clean slate, you can restart the kernel to clear all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "Some useful keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **RUN A CELL (and move focus to the next cell)** - *SHIFT+RETURN (SHIFT+ENTER on PC)* \n",
    " - **RUN A CELL (and keep focus to the current cell)** - *CTRL+RETURN (CTRL+ENTER on PC)* \n",
    " - **ADD A CELL ABOVE** - *Esc -> A* (-> means followed by)\n",
    " - **ADD A CELL BELOW** - *Esc -> B* (-> means followed by)\n",
    " - **CONVERT A CELL TO MARKDOWN** - *Esc -> M*\n",
    " - **CONVERT A CELL TO CODE** - *Esc -> Y*"
