    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is computer code?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already gotten a glimpse of programming above. We used variables (e.g. a, b, c, d, e), operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, **), built-in functions (e.g. print())\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELINSTB** (Explain Like I've Never Seen This Before)\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language is a set of instructions followed EXPLICITLY by a computer. Like a natural language (between people...or people and LLMs), a programming language has nouns (stored data) and verbs (actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**A little bit deeper about Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language and everything in Python is an object. What's that mean? Objects are members of a group of similar things; the groups are called classes. And every object has special properties (attributes) and functions (methods) specific to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*So 'a' is an object?* Yes, 'a' is an object that is of a numeric data type.\n",
    "*What about 'print()', I thought that was a verb?* Yes, even 'print' is an object, a function object. Think of print as a printer; that's a thing that prints (a blender blends, a television televises, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Data Types\n",
    "(Read [WTOP Ch 3](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/03-semantics-variables.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables store the data we use in programs. You can think of a variable as a box with a label on it (or a mailbox with an address...that happens to be a location in your computer's memory). The name of the variable is the label on the box, and it can be almost anything:\n",
    "\n",
    " - variable names should only contain letters, dashes, underscores, and numbers.\n",
    " - must start with a letter\n",
    " - should be descriptive of the value it's storing (what's in the box?). This will make your code easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we create a variable, we have to **assign** it a value (even if that value is empty...more on that later). We assign values using single = sign.\n",
    "\n",
    " - y = 5\n",
    " - s = 'hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "Variables hold our data and keep track of the values (see above), but what kinds of data can variables hold. For now, we'll start with three simple data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric** - integers (round numbers) and floats (decimal numbers)\n",
    "- **String** - any text (e.g. a single character, a password, an entire book). Strings are denoted by quotes, either 'hello' or \"hello\" is fine.\n",
    "- **Boolean** - True or False. True and False are keywords and will be color-highlighted when used."
