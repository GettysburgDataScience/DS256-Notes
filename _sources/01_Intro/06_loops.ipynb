This is useful if you need to perform the same set of actions on several (tens or maybe hundreds) of different items in some container (e.g. loading files from a list of filenames, parsing text into sentences or clauses, extracting specific data that meet some criteria from a larger set). Once you understand loops, you'll find they're incredibly useful for automating tedious analyses. BUT for large data and complex operations, loops can get very slow; so for many data science use cases, we try to find ways to avoid using loops.\n",
