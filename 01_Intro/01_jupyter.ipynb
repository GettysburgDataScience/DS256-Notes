    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter (stands for Julia-Python-R) Notebooks are coding environments that let you write, annotate, and run code a chunk at a time. These chunks are contained in *cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "The notebooks we'll use in this class comprise two kinds of cells:\n",
    " - *Markdown* - text annotation (like this cell).\n",
    " - *Code* - cells that will run code (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell type is noted in the lower right corner (and you can change the cell type from there).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a kernel as a computational session. The kernel also keeps track of all the variables you've created in the session. If you want to run your code from a clean slate, you can restart the kernel to clear all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "Some useful keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **RUN A CELL (and move focus to the next cell)** - *SHIFT+RETURN (SHIFT+ENTER on PC)* \n",
    " - **RUN A CELL (and keep focus to the current cell)** - *CTRL+RETURN (CTRL+ENTER on PC)* \n",
    " - **ADD A CELL ABOVE** - *Esc -> A* (-> means followed by)\n",
    " - **ADD A CELL BELOW** - *Esc -> B* (-> means followed by)\n",
    " - **CONVERT A CELL TO MARKDOWN** - *Esc -> M*\n",
    " - **CONVERT A CELL TO CODE** - *Esc -> Y*"
