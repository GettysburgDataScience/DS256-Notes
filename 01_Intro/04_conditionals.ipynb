    "This gives one path of code if the condition is met and another path for all other cases.\n",

    " - If I'm not sleepy, I'll watch the fourth quarter of the game. Else if I'm a little sleepy, I'll watch the first five minutes then go to bed. Else, I'll go to bed right away.\n",
    " - If the requested withdrawal amount is more than the amount in your checking account, the transaction will be declined, else if you have the funds but the remaining balance is less than $50, the funds will be transferred to the vendor and the buyer will get a \"low balance\" notification. Else, the funds will be transferred to the vendor.\n",

    "The if-elif-else statements don't have to be particularly related:\n",
